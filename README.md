# ScopicBidApi
It is app that developed for test case of Scopic Software.

To run successfully, you need to have RabbitMq on your local machine.

Database is used with remote connection.

After you run the project, you can see endpoints on https://localhost:44382/swagger.

Note:I just wrote 2  unit test cases as an example.Coverage should be more than 80%, but I didn't have time to implement all of this.
 
Thank you in advance.
